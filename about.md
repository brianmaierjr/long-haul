	<p class="intro"> Hi, I'm Rafael Cattan, an economist interested in data-sciente, GenAI, economic dynamics, Stock-Flow consistent modeling, econometrics, and in how we will overcome climate change. </p>
	<p>I'm a data scientist working in the banking industry. I enjoy conducting data analysis, machine learning models, developing AI applications, and, of course, dataviz.
		I hold a Ph.D in Economics at the University of Campinas <a href="https://www.eco.unicamp.br/">UNICAMP</a>, where I have conducted a research on growth, cycles and climate change. The research was focused on themes as diverse as the role of finance on capitalist dynamics, how fiscal policy could have curtailed an economic crisis in Brazil, and how the macroeconomic system interacts with the environmental system under a non-optimizing framework.</p>
