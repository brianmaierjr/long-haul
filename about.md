	<p class="intro"> Hi, I'm Rafael Cattan, an economist interested in economic dynamics, Stock-Flow consistente modelling, econometrics, and in how we are goind to overcome climate change. </p>
	<p>I hold a Ph.D in Economics at the University of Campinas <a href="https://www.eco.unicamp.br/">UNICAMP</a>, where I have conducted a research on growth, cycles and climate change. The research was focused on themes as diverse as the role of finance on capitalist dynamics, how fiscal policy could have curtailed an economic crisis in Brazil, and how the macroeconomic system interacts with the environmental system under a non-optimizing framework.</p>
