### Why do we need a macroeconomic model?

Economic models are a representation of reality. In order to understand the observed trends in the economy - such as crisis, how income grows, why people are unemployed, or why prices are soaring, we need to abstract a number of elements and focus on others. 

What to neglect and what to consider is a crucial part of building economic models and determinant of the conclusions that will be drawn from them. Notwithstanding, we share the view of George E. P. Box that  *"All models are wrong, but some are useful‚Äù*. 


Hence, depending on the assumptions that you make - that is, what you consider relevant and how you explain it - you derive explanations for real events. For instance, if you have a theory for unemployment, you may be able to propose solutions for high unemployment rates.



Some real worl problems, however, are often neglegtec by the standard economic theory. One of them is the role of finance in economic dynamics. By often guaranteing  perfect competition, little emphasis is put on crisis, demand fluctuations, bubbles, and continuous unemployment of resources (including labor!).




In the real world, however, we indeed observe all of those elements. Post-Keynesian economics tries to bridge the gap between economic theory and reality. One of the key aspects of this post-Keynesian economics is the key role played by financial markets, and the role played by money. (If you are curious about this research agenda I encourage you to visit [this](https://www.postkeynesian.net/) website, or to watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEROFQIao4o) talk from Marc Lavoie). 

Financial crisis are not only a long-lasting characteristic of capitalist economies, but they became more frequent for the past 40 years. By retrieving data from the Harvard Business School [website](https://www.hbs.edu/behavioral-finance-and-financial-stability/data/Pages/global.aspx), have calculated the number of banking crisis, by year, since 1800:

This is no coincidence, given that, in 1971, the gold standard was abandoned.






But how can we embody all those features? A growing body of the post-Keynesian literature has adopted a modelling framework which cover precisely the importance of financial instruments for economic dynamics in the so-called Stock-Flow consistent modelling (SFC).

By employing a tight accounting system in which every expenditure for a sector represents an income for another (**flow consistency**),  every financial instrument represents an asset for somebody, and a liability for somebody else (**stock-consitency**). And that, every positive (negative) financial balance accumulates into wealth (debt) (**stock-flow consitency**).


Indeed, a number of works are already employing some of those features to develop empirical models. See examples for [England](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2016/a-dynamic-model-of-financial-balances-for-the-uk.pdf), [Denmark](http://www.levyinstitute.org/publications/an-empirical-stock-flow-consistent-macroeconomic-model-for-denmark), and [Italy](http://www.levyinstitute.org/publications/a-stock-flow-consistent-quarterly-model-of-the-italian-economy).







### Agents and transactions

In order to understand the macroeconomic features we need to ask which are the agents and how they earn and expend their financial inflows.

Agents are classifiend in accordance with the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) as:

1. Households
2. Non-Financial Corporations
3. Financial Corporations
4. Government
5. Foreing Sector


The agents relate to eachother through two channels: a) transactions, and b) balance sheet. That is, they relate through **flows** (e.g., consumption, interest payments, government transfers) and through financial **stocks** (shares, bonds, deposits, etc.).  

Let's first check-out which are the most important transaction. With some cleaning procedures, below we illustrate their average values in relation to GDP:

	<figcaption>Fig2. - Key Flows (% GDP) figcaption</figcaption>
</figure>



By definition, however, each expenditure for a sector, represents an income for another. So it is key to understand if those transactions represent income sources our expenditures, for each sector. In order to understand that, we have calculted each sector source of income, and their respective expenditures. The results are illustrate in the diagram below:

</figure>
    </div>
</body>



A number of features could be highlighted from this result. I'll only highlight those which illustrate how actual data and economic growth theory diverge. **First**, we can see that GDP which is net value added is a source of income not only for firms, but also for banks, households, and even government (this last one, only for accounting purposes). Given that most macroeconomic growth models only rely on firms output, we can see that the real macroeconomic accounting system is significantly more complex than most theoretical representations of it. 

**Second**, interests and wealth (which also aggregates capital-related income) are an important income source for banks, as expected, but also for households, and firms. This stresses a financial source of income which derives from balance sheet relations. For instance, if households hold firms' equities or government bonds, this will influence their income sources, and, consequently, their expenditures's level. This real-financial nexus, although clear in the data (in even in the common sense) is largely neglected on mainstream macroeconomic models.

**Third**, transfers are a relevant share of households' disposable income. We can see that this source of income is similar to wages in absolute levels, meaning that a proper representation of households on macroeconomic models, should not overlook the distributive role played by the goverment. 

**Forth** firms, households, the government, an even banks invest (i.e. consume fixed capital). Most growth models embody none but firms as the responsibles for capital accumulation. Investments play a crucial role on economic dynamics in the short and - depending on your your theoretical background - in the long run as well. For this reason, it is key to embody some of these features in models that aim to study real phenomena through macroeconomic lens.
