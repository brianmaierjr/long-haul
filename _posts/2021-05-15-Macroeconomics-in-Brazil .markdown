## Agents and transactions

In order to understand the macroeconomic features we need to ask which are the agents and how they earn and expend their financial inflows.

Agents are classifiend in accordance with the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) as:

1. Households
2. Non-Financial Corporations
3. Financial Corporations
4. Government
5. Foreing Sector

By definition, however, each expenditure for a sector, represents an income for another. So it is key to understand if those transactions represent income sources our expenditures, for each sector. In order to understand that, we have calculted each sector source of income, and their respective expenditures. The results are illustrate in the diagram below:

A number of features could be highlighted from this result. I'll only highlight those which illustrate how actual data and economic growth theory diverge. First, we can see that
