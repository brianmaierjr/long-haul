### Agents and transactions

In order to understand the macroeconomic features we need to ask which are the agents and how they earn and expend their financial inflows.

Agents are classifiend in accordance with the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) as:

1. Households
2. Non-Financial Corporations
3. Financial Corporations
4. Government
5. Foreing Sector


The agents relate to eachother through two channels: a) transactions, and b) balance sheet. That is, they relate through **flows** (e.g., consumption, interest payments, government transfers) and through financial **stocks** (shares, bonds, deposits, etc.).  

Let's first check-out which are the most important transaction. With some cleaning procedures, below we illustrate their average values in relation to GDP:

By definition, however, each expenditure for a sector, represents an income for another. So it is key to understand if those transactions represent income sources our expenditures, for each sector. In order to understand that, we have calculted each sector source of income, and their respective expenditures. The results are illustrate in the diagram below:

A number of features could be highlighted from this result. I'll only highlight those which illustrate how actual data and economic growth theory diverge. **First**, we can see that GDP which is net value added is a source of income not only for firms, but also for banks, households, and even government (this last one, only for accounting purposes). Given that most macroeconomic growth models only rely on firms output, we can see that the real macroeconomic accounting system is significantly more complex than most theoretical representations of it. 

**Second**, interests and wealth (which aggregates capital-related income) are an important income source for banks, as expected, but also for households, and firms. This stresses a financial source of income which derives from balance sheet relations. For instance, if households hold firms' equities or government bonds, this will influence their income sources, and, consequently, their expenditures's level. This real-financial nexus, although clear in the data (in even in the common sense) is largely neglected on mainstream macroeconomic models.

**Third** Transfers is a relevant share of households' disposable income. We can see that this source of income is similar to wages in absolute levels, meaning that a proper representation of households on macroeconomic models, should not overlook the distributive role played by the goverment. 

**Forth** Firms, households, the government, an even banks invest (i.e. consume fixed capital). Most growth models embody none but firms as the responsibles for capital accumulation. Investments play a crucial role on economic dynamics in the short and - depending on your your theoretical background - in the long run as well. For this reason, it is key to embody some of these features in models that aim to study real phenomena through macroeconomic lens. 


But how can we embody all those features? The so-called Stock-Flow consistent modelling is able to simultaneously, guarantee some of those characteristicis. By employing a tight accounting system in which every expenditure for a sector represents an income for another (**flow consistency**),  every financial instrument represents an asset for somebody, and a liability for somebody else (**stock-consitency**). And that, if a sector's inflows outweights its outflows, it necessarily accumulates wealth (**stock-flow consitency**). 

Indeed, a number of works are already employing some of those features to develop empirical models. See examples for [England](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2016/a-dynamic-model-of-financial-balances-for-the-uk.pdf), [Denmark](http://www.levyinstitute.org/publications/an-empirical-stock-flow-consistent-macroeconomic-model-for-denmark), and [Italy](http://www.levyinstitute.org/publications/a-stock-flow-consistent-quarterly-model-of-the-italian-economy).
