It has been a looong time since my last post... :frowning:

Meanwhile, I have started my master's degree with a focus on Machine Learning. For preparation I have finished [Andrew Ng's course in ML](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/). If you have never heard of this course and want to break into ML I think this is a fantastic starting point. The explanations are concise and clear even without prior knowledge. The course consists of a series of videos and accompanying programming assignments, for which you'll need [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) (or its open-source twin [Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/)).

To be able to come back to what I have learned and revisit individual topics I decided to write a summary in my own words. This also helped me to get my thoughts straight and memorize the content better. I figured someone else might be interested in it too, so I put it all online for you to read.

You can find the summary [here](http://www.tiefenauer.info/ml_de). Note it's only available in German. Maybe I will translate it to English someday if I have the time.

Please drop me a comment if you find anything unclear or (god forbid!) you find a mistake. :thumbsup:
