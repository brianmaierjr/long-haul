It has been a looong time since my last post&#8230;

Meanwhile, I have started my master&#8217;s degree with a focus on machine learning and have gone through [Andrew Ng&#8217;s fantastic course in ML](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/)Â for preparation. As a means of better understanding and memorizing what I have learned I wrote a summary in my own words along the way (in German).

You can read all about it [here](http://www.tiefenauer.info/ml/).
