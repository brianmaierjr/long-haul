### Integrating finance to macro

On the previous post, we have seen that the most usual macroeconomic modelling tool (neoclassical DSGE models) have paid little attention to the real-financial nexus. This was particularly true for pre-2008 models. 

As we have mentioned, however, the post-Keynesian literature is precisly characterised for integrating the real and the monetary aspects of the economic system. In this post, I will illustrate: a) an alternative modelling framework that addresses some of the drawbacks of neoclassical economics, and b) how this new framework relates to the observed data from Brazil.




#### The SFC methodology

A large strand of the post-Keynesian literature has embraced the so-called stock-flow consistent (SFC) modelling. 

SFC models normally embody five sectors: firms, households, government, the
central bank, and private banks. The models are designed to ensure that - as in any real economy - the income inflows to one sector are outflows from other sectors. The same applies to financial transactions. These flows accumulate into debt, if the sector expends more than it earns. Or the flows accumulate into wealth, if the sector inflows outweights its outflows. Thus, the models are stock flow consistent.

SFC models are nothing but an accounting framework, but they are usually employed with post-Keynesian (PK) assumptions, which gives the motion to the accounting structure.


Technically, the model are differential or difference system of equations, whose solution depends on the initial state of the system, besides the constant parameters. 

This approach constrasts with DSGE models for not relying on constraint optimization schemes. In fact, the very concept of optimality is contested, and the system can have multiple equilibria, non stable equilibrium, or even diverge from a given steady state.


SFC models tend to assume realistic behavioural equations in which agents cannot foresee the future (as they normally do in DSGE), and define their decisions on ad-hoc assumptions. Besides that, its stock-flow structure is largely based on the system of national accounts, making this framework useful to replicate and study actual macroeconomic systems.

Indeed, a number of works are already employing some of those features to develop empirical models. See examples for [England](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2016/a-dynamic-model-of-financial-balances-for-the-uk.pdf), [Denmark](http://www.levyinstitute.org/publications/an-empirical-stock-flow-consistent-macroeconomic-model-for-denmark), and [Italy](http://www.levyinstitute.org/publications/a-stock-flow-consistent-quarterly-model-of-the-italian-economy).


In the next section I will show the core data supporting the SFC methodology, and use the Brazilian economy as an illustrative case. This will allow us to see important connections between financial and real transactions. Also, important features of Brazil's macroeconomic system will be highlighted. 


#### Stocks and flows in the Brazilian economy

In order to understand the macroeconomic features of the brazilian economy we need to ask, first, which are the agents and how they earn and expend their financial inflows.

Agents are classifiend in accordance with the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) as:

1. Households
2. Non-Financial Corporations
3. Financial Corporations
4. Government
5. Rest of the World (RoW)
6. Non-profit institutions serving households (NPISHs)


The agents relate to eachother through two channels: a) transactions, and b) balance sheet. That is, they relate through **flows** (e.g., consumption, interest payments, government transfers) and through financial **stocks** (shares, bonds, deposits, etc.).  

Let's first check-out which are the most important transaction. With some cleaning procedures, below we illustrate their average values between 2000 and 2017, in relation to GDP, and their min-max ranges:

</figure>
    </div>
</body>



By definition, however, each expenditure for a sector, represents an income for another. So it is key to understand if those transactions represent income sources or expenditures, for each sector. In order to understand that, we have calculated each sector's source of income, and its respective expenditures. The results are illustrate in the diagram below:

Many are the insights we can highlight from this figure. 

**First**, an important feature of Figure 2 is that productive activity is not only an important source of income for firms, but also for banks, households, and even the government (this last one, only for accounting purposes). In this sense a proper representation of the BR economy, should not neglect this source of income for banks, and specially for households. The latter category includes informal activities, small business, production of goods for own consumption (e.g. small farming), and even imputed rent, for those who own their property.   


**Second**, interests and wealth (which aggregates capital-related income) are an important income source for banks, as expected, but also for households, and firms. This stresses a financial source of income which derives from balance sheet relations. For instance, if households hold firms' equities or government bonds, this will influence their income sources, and, consequently, their expenditures's level. This real-financial nexus, although clear in the data (in even in the common sense) is largely employed on SFC models.


**Third**, transfers are a relevant share of households' disposable income. We can see that this source of income is similar to wages in absolute levels, meaning that a proper representation of the Brazilian economy with macroeconomic models should not overlook the distributive role played by the goverment. 

**Forth** firms, households, the government, an even banks invest (i.e. consume fixed capital). Most growth models embody none but firms as the responsibles for capital accumulation. Investments play a crucial role on economic dynamics in the short and - depending on your your theoretical background - in the long run as well. For this reason, it is key to embody some of these features in models that aim to study real phenomena through macroeconomic lens. 

These features represent the key transactions being made in Brazil' macroeconomic system. But many are the transactions that derive from the previous accumulation of wealth. Interest and wealth-related income, as we have seen, are important income sources for households, for instance. 

On the next section we will evaluate how the macroeconomic agents relate to each other through finance.


#### Financial Stocks

In Brazil's system of national accounts (SNA), financial instruments are basically:

1. Deposits;
2. Bonds;
3. Equities (shares);
5. Loans;
6. Insurance reserves;
6. Others


The first question we want to adress is which are the most important financial instruments. Retrieving data from the SNA, and with some manipulation, we could find that deposits are the most signifcant financial instrument in absolute levels, reaching 160 % of GDP, on average, between 2004 and 2017. Being followed by bonds (145 %), loans (121%), equities (95 %), insurance reserves (44 %), and finally by others (22 %), as illustrated below

But how each of these instruments are distributed among the economic agents?

Unfortunately, this information is only available for 2009. So we will first show who owes whom through a matrix which illustrates the net financial debt and assets, in respect to the other economic sectors. This is illustrate on Figure 4, besides their net financial position in respect to itself, so we can see if the sector is a net debtor or creditor in the economy:

We can see, for example, that banks' are net debtors of households (grey), but are largely net creditors of the government. The high level of deposits in the economy, and the key role played by treasury bonds on the financial markets structure help to explain this feature.

Moreover, we can see that the foreing economy (ROW) is a net debtor or the Brazilian domestic economy, and that most of the foreing participation is with firms (NFC)
