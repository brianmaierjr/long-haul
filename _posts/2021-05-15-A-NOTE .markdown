### Why do we need a macroeconomic model?

Economic models are a representation of reality. To understand observed trends in the economy - such as financial crisis, how income grows, why people are unemployed or why prices are rising, we need to abstract a number of elements and focus on others. 



What to neglect and what to consider is a crucial part of building economic models. The more elements (or endogenous variables) a model incorporates, the harder it is to see the model's insights. On the other hand, the less variables you employ, the more insightful the model is, albeit more information you loose. For this reasone, we share the view, however, of George E. P. Box that *"All models are wrong, but some are useful "*.


Economic models have different purposes. One of them is designing economic policies. Given that economic models are often a mathematical framework, they can provide numerical insights in respect to identifying a problem, proposing solutions, and estimating the impacts.


Some real world problems, however, are often neglected by the standard economic theory, which is know as neoclassical economics. One of these problems is the role of finance on economic dynamics. Financial markets include several agents and instruments. The creation of credit by banks, the issue of bonds by national treasuries, and even interest-beargin deposits, are all part of the financial system. Notwishstanding, most of these elements are absent in the mainstream macroeconomic modelling, specially those of economic cycles and growth.


The Nobel prize laureate [Paul Romer](https://paulromer.net/the-trouble-with-macro/WP-Trouble.pdf), for instance, has been a vocal critic of the current state of modern neoclassical macroeconomics. The author cites as an example the following quote from a renowned colleague to highlight one of the key drawbacks of this theoretical approach: *"although in the interest of disclosure, I must admit that I am myself less than totally convinced of the importance of money outside the case of large inflations"*. 

In this perspective, money is usually a means of exchanging goods. When considered, banking credit is normally demanded according to the agents future income streams, being of little relevance for the overall macroeconomic analysis. This was particularly true before the 2008 Great Financial Crisis.

But is money, or any other financial instruement irrelevant to understand  economic cycles?


In 2008, for instance. we could see that financial markets are not neutral in the economic process.  And the 2008 crisis was not an isolated case.  Financial crisis are a long-lasting characteristic of capitalism, but they became more frequent for the past 40 years, since the end of the Bretton Woods agreement. By retrieving data from the Harvard Business School [website](https://www.hbs.edu/behavioral-finance-and-financial-stability/data/Pages/global.aspx), I have calculated the number of banking crisis, by year, since 1800:

So why "nobody saw it coming"? The workhorse of current neoclassical macroeconomics are DSGE models. In this framework, events such as economic crisis, when not ruled out by construction, are exogenous shocks, and not breeded withing the economic system.

Surprisingly this drawback of standard neoclassical modelling, was only recognised after the 2008 great financial crisis by neoclassical economists. Joseph Stiglitz [said](https://watermark.silverchair.com/grx057.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAqAwggKcBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggKNMIICiQIBADCCAoIGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMyGsjZH08CxN0HlbaAgEQgIICU4PGQpCmXG-i-cmub5b-Bn7l-Ifc-aK2CcB-3a1OKYq3Sc0DmoE7nY8yeVlCFT8XdBnLu4VfLdYHzaCZNQMxBq6e5wEcmLOuDvX2636Yma3PYjqhaX203rrffNuGQ8AjNh376GaTQcdJtjr16jmD9fPLR6OHMFvUZkc4vkmfHtVGxmk7_M2RVRTrOflcMX9sYoQzwOa4I3O1wM4lI8T6f5TkojBZiFxo_CdyfZkaVqb2-vbs09eXCd3Yq8HSYHaK2crCCK9QrEgUSO1Q0V39o6EMrU8Z0V2aCN7mxABHYDbyyud5pYamISOiYiW0hJPPz6imRuZ7qdVr4amnKo9mWDy8pnS5Ouw63wF_2ksexjna29aWb-0x6tZCVGrHcH3eRcSgwaNtiWanO2C7vx89kWBgq4mgEmHmn2MSithayE5cycBxcHA73rTRGIcRyY-Iw9QuBvdPHYd2ec85tgKcVOljhAReL5evjs--GqqARVo21_4m1l-tioUecKf1PByhHqPIgWo1MYOGyr4UAe4jluj3yuKp2ocws9cLaRdoy3Ma9krWyon5ZeRT-Tz_p6MnyMAQp3gebJcvM88De3n2n9jlzPLQXc9mFL-ZEuWHWK8hPTEbR1p1BlEf6xZvxtE_5ccsm6fLKsg2BGfYzEIv9UJtm_SACaUWIHok3ty55PSYv-99bJUUyNsvuKL9XDbu5SQBjac7gnc-x1wTznPd_MZw25cZuAJtGlmtJ--GBm_fJG9Ll92nK9fM-tFFPPJk6bstlB7qJSPQAJsxItSil0zIZec) the following about DSGE models: **Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models, which have played such an important role in modern discussions of macroeconomics, in my judgement fail to serve the functions which a well-designed macroeconomic model should perform**


Hence, if your model does not include financial markets, assume perfect functioning financial markets (most pre-2008 models) or simply consider that financial markets only impose frictions and short-term fluctuations on real activity (most post-2008 literature), your conclusions may be misleading.


Morever, the increasing frequency of financial crisis, is not the only justification for including more realistic, non-efficient, financial markets into macroeconomic modelling. Modern financialised economies are greatly influenced by endogenous monetary components such as credit cycles, equities, housing and even commodities prices fluctuations  - all of them being an integral part of the financial system. 

In order to illustrate how the "real" economy and the financial economy have strong co-movements, I have calculated a financial composite index, which is a simple average of shares prices, residential and commodities prices (All of them available in the St. Luis Fed [website](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/)). Then, I have contrasted this composite with the industrial production in the US from 1992 until today. 

The results are illustrated below:

It is possible to see a strong correlation between the two series both in upward and downward economic cycles. Although not conclusive, this highlights a real-financial connection that is largely missed on neoclassical economics. 

The positive association between the series is also clear by plotting their growth rates for the same period:

Another important source of imbalances in the real economy comes from credit. Credit cycles, which are normally fueled by increasing asset prices, play an important role to determine investments. Unlike most DSGE models, however, credit - and other external financing instruments - can be issued independently from available funding (e.g. deposits). 

That is, finance is created endogenous by the banking system and, often, agents become overindebted and financial institutions develop into a greater financial fragility.


Below we illustrate the relation between investments and nonfinancial corporations indebtement (securities + loans) in the US:

	 <figcaption>Fig5. - Investments, Debt and Recessions (% growth)  </figcaption>
      </figure>
    </div>
</body>

We can see that strong credit growth preceded most US recessions since the 1960's, the 2008 one being a remarkable example of private sector leveraging process. 

The relation between indebtment and GDP dynamics can also be framed by the sectoral net lending - which represents its borrowing (-) or lending (+) position in each year. Normally, high-growth periods are associated to higher leveraging periods (increasing borrowing needs). Below, I've plotted the change on private business sector net lending positions and GDP growth rates for the US to illustrate this macroeconomic feature:

<body>
    <div align="center">
      <figure>

	 <figcaption>Fig5. - Net Lending and GDP (% growth)  </figcaption>
      </figure>
    </div>
</body>

The negative relation between corroborated by comparing the correlation between GDP and the net lending of households (NL_HH and NLa_HH), and business (NL_PVT, NLa_PVT), as we can see below:



<body>
      <figure>
  <iframe src="/assets/img/corrp.html" frameborder="0" height="650" width="700"    display:block></iframe>
      </figure>
</body>


We can see that, as expected, the more households, and in a minor extend the whole private sector borrows (- sign) in relation to its income, the higher are the economic growth rates. Thats why we see a negative correlation between the two series.

This illustrates, again, that debt and GDP dynamics have a strong an structural relation. As a result, ommiting financial markets from macroeconomic analysis is fundamentally flawed.

But how can we do that? 


Among the alternatives to incorporate financial aspects into macroeconomic analysis we highlight the post-Keynesian approach. One of the key aspects of the post-Keynesian economics is the key role played by financial markets, and the role played by money itself. (If you are curious about this research agenda I encourage you to visit [this](https://www.postkeynesian.net/) website, or to watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEROFQIao4o) talk from Marc Lavoie)


Some fundamental aspects of this approach, alongside illustrative data of will be addressed on the next post. See you [here](#brmodel)
