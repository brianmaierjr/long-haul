### Misallocation of talent, human capital formation, and development in Brazil


Abstract
In this article, we elaborate a general equilibrium model to study why the relative salary
of teachers is higher in regions with low and middle income in Brazil and how it affects the
product. In this model, occupational choices, especially for teachers, are affected by distortions in 
the labor market and in educational goods, which in turn have a direct impact
on the formation of human capital. After calibrating the model, using the Generalized
Moments Method, for the Brazilian scenario, it was found that there is a misallocation
of talent in the Brazilian economy and reallocating more skilled people to the teaching
occupation could increase GDP by 68.28 %.
