### Misallocation of talent, human capital formation, and development in Brazil


In this paper, we elaborate a General Equilibrium Model to study why the relative salary
of teachers is higher in low and middle income regions in Brazil. In this model, teachers’
human capital endowment is a source of positive externalities for all workers and occupational 
choices are made based on incentives. However, individuals’ occupational decisions
are distorted by barriers in the labor market and educational goods, which in turn cause a
misallocation of talent and harm economic growth. After calibrating the model using the
Method of Moments and data from Brazilian states from 2015, we performed a series of
counterfactual exercises that show that reducing distortions in the labor and educational
market would increase Brazilian GDP by a value between 9.19% and 43.49%.
Keywords: Misallocation; Frictions; Human Capital; Externalities; Development.
