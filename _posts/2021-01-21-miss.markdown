### Misallocation of talent, human capital formation, and development in Brazil


In this paper, we elaborate a General Equilibrium Model to study why the relative wage
of teachers is higher in low and middle income regions in Brazil. We define a Roy model
where there is an externality in the occupational occupational choice because teachers’
human capital is important to the formation of human capital of all workers. Then,
when people with more idiosyncratic ability choose to become a teacher, all the workforce
has benefits. However, in our model individuals’ occupational decisions are distorted by
barriers in the labor and educational goods markets, which in turn cause a misallocation
of talent and harm economic growth. After calibrating the model using the Method of
Moments and data from Brazil, we find that distortions are an important factor to explain
differences in relative wages. Moreover, we performed a series of counterfactual exercises
that show that reducing distortions in the labor and educational market would increase
Brazilian GDP by a value between 9.19% and 43.49%.
