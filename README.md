Long Haul is a minimal jekyll theme built with SASS and focuses on long form blog posts. It is meant to be used as a starting point for a jekyll blog/website.

If you really enjoy Long Haul and want to give me credit somewhere on the internet send or tweet out your experience with Long Haul and tag me [@brianmaierjr](https://twitter.com/brianmaierjr).

**I made a few changes to make sure Jekyll live-reload works for Long Haul. This includes removal of all Gulp related files and configs which were halting Jekyll live-reload. I also removed http_parser and support-for gem as we do not need them anymore to live-reload. Webrick has also been updated. [@iambozdar](https://iambozdar.com/)**
