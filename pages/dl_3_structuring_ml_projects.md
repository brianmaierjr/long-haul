title: "Deep Learning (3/5): Structuring ML projects"
intro: | 
    This course focuses on conceptual aspects and workflow planning rather than introducing new algorihms, technologies or frameworks. The goal of this course is to equip you with knowledge you would otherwise have to earn through experience. Therefore, despite being short, this course can make a huge difference for you when you start out with your own project. It can save you from going in the wrong direction for months and then realizing your work was all for nothing. Due to the nature of this course there are no quizzes or programming assignments. Instead you get to sit in a “Machine Learning flight simulator”, where you are presented with a real-world problem and then have to decide how to act next.

| 1                   | The first week focuses on setting up a strategy when working on a DL task. It also reflects on how to measure an algorithms performance and how to improve it.                   | Orthogonalization<br>satisficing and optimizing metrics<br>Train/Dev/Test-Set distributions<br>avoidable bias<br>human level performance |
| 2                   | The second week introduces common errors that can lead to poor performance. It also shows how to find those errors and how to deal with them.                   | error analysis<br>label cleaning<br>Transfer Learning<br>Multi-Task learning<br>E2E-Deep Learning |
