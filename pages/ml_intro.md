title: "Introduction to Machine Learning"
intro: | 
    This is an introductory course on various ML techniques. You learn about the distinction of supervised and unsupervised learning as well as some key algorithms in each of these areas. This course has become a de-facto standard for people wanting to break into ML. It is free of charge which might attribute to its immense popularity. The exercises in this course are all done in Matlab. A lot of universities have student licenses to give away, so you might ask your tech department for one if you’re currently enrolled in a university. If not you can also use Octave (Matlab’s open-source twin).
