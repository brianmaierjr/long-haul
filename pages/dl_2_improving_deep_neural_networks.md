title: "Deep Learning (2/5): Improving Deep Neural Networks"
intro: | 
    This course focuses on common problems you might encounter when working on DL-projects. The course includes some useful recipes that might help you where to tune your algorithm when it does not perform the way it should. It also introduces some best practices for training your own NN and also some useful techniques to speed up the learning process.

## Course overview
**Week 1** introduces the various hyperparameters of a model and how to choose reasonable values for them. You will also learn how to identify problematic behavior of algorithm and where it may be rooted.
**Week 2** introduces some optimization algorithms that may speed up the overall learning process. 
**Week 3** wraps up on hyperparameters and how to find optimal values for them. It also introduces Softmax as an alternative activation function for multiclass-classification. This is also the week where you get to know a DL-Framework (TensorFlow) for the first time.
